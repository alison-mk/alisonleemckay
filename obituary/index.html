      <p>Premise:<br>
      On August 29, 2014 Sher Kung was killed in a collision with a truck while bicycling to work. The accident took place when a driver turned left across a painted bike lane on 2nd Avenue in downtown Seattle.</p>
      <p>Like hundreds of morning bike commuters, I rode past the scene of the accident and witnessed the aftermath: a mangled bike, a white sheet covering a shape on the pavement, a cyclist’s foot exposed.</p>
      <p>Prior to the accident, I had commuted to work via this bike lane every day for a year. Terrified but undeterred, I did not change my route to work for over a year.</p>
      <p>Soon after Sher Kung’s death, a piecemeal obituary began forming in my mind for my own potential death in the 2nd Avenue bike lane. New phrases and lines materialized each day I rode to work. This process was unintentional at first, but it eventually became morbidly deliberate.</p>
      <p>--</p>
      <p>She really loved biking.</p>
      <p>--</p>
      <p>She wanted a city full of bike lanes.</p>
      <p>--</p>
      <p>She wanted people to feel safe in the lanes; summer tourists, commuters in the rain, families on weekends.</p>
      <p>--</p>
      <p>The more drivers she told personally not to turn on a red light, the safer it would be.</p>
      <p>--</p>
      <p>Would it be?</p>
      <p>--</p>
      <p>Would the friend remember next time she drove down 2nd Avenue? Or the coworker who listened but seemed distracted?</p>
      <p>--</p>
      <p>How does a city learn to follow new rules? How do we create the city we want to live in?</p>
      <p>--</p>
      <p>The presence of bikes in the lane reminds cars to be careful.</p>
      <p>This was her mantra.</p>
      <p>--</p>
      <p>She tried not to yell at the cars.</p>
      <p>Especially when their windows were closed.</p>
      <p>--</p>
      <p>She tried not to get angry, tried not to gesture incoherently at oblivious drivers.</p>
      <p>--</p>
      <p>She consulted friends about what kinds of gestures might make sense to a driver, versus gestures that might look simply like excited waving.</p>
      <p>--</p>
      <p>She wrote to the city with ideas for improving safety in the bike lane, like adding signs at parking garage entrances and making the protected left turn lights more prominent.</p>
      <p>--</p>
      <p>The city did not respond, but the city did post traffic safety officers to protect cyclists at the most hazardous intersections.</p>
      <p>--</p>
      <p>She recognized other 2nd Avenue bike commuters. They nodded and smiled at stop lights.</p>
      <p>--</p>
      <p>A community of bicyclists endured, committed to this route.</p>
      <p>--</p>
      <p>She saw other cyclists shout at cars, defending their space, hearing fear alongside anger in their voices.</p>
      <p>--</p>
      <p>Yet she watched cyclists run the same red lights as cars, and she ran these lights herself.</p>
      <p>--</p>
      <p>If there was no traffic, did it matter?</p>
      <p>--</p>
      <p>How does a community choose not to follow certain rules? How do we shape our communities?</p>
      <p>--</p>
      <p>Three months, six months, and then a year passed.</p>
      <p>--</p>
      <p>She witnessed another bicyclist get hit by a car turning illegally across the 2nd Avenue bike lane. He bled but walked away.</p>
      <p>------</p>
      <p>The city continues to improve the 2nd Avenue bike lane. Cars still endanger cyclists and pedestrians. Cyclists still endanger themselves.</p>
      <p>The bicycle, pedestrian and motor vehicle communities endure and evolve, tangled in a complicated dance, vying for space, ownership and awareness.</p>
